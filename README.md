# jsFundamentalWorkshop
Part one assumes participants range in skill from "turn it off and turn it on again" to an intermediate level in a programming language other than Javascript.

## The goal: 
  To get participants from *"I can't do anything in Javascript"* to *"this seems easy, where can I learn more?"*

```
[the answer, of course, being partTwo of this workshop!]

## Start Here:
[more coming soon...]
